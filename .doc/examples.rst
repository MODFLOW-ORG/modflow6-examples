Original TWRI MODFLOW example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This problem is described in McDonald and Harbaugh (1988) and duplicated in
Harbaugh and McDonald (1996). This problem is also is distributed with
MODFLOW-2005 (Harbaugh, 2005) and MODFLOW 6 (Langevin and others, 2017).

One-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field Comparison of MODFLOW 6 transport with MT3DMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The purpose of this script is to (1) recreate the example problems that were first
described in the 1999 MT3DMS report, and (2) compare MODFLOW 6-GWT solutions to the
established MT3DMS solutions.
Ten example problems appear in the 1999 MT3DMS manual, starting on page 130.
This notebook demonstrates example 1 from the list below:
1.  *One-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field*,
2.  One-Dimensional Transport with Nonlinear or Nonequilibrium Sorption,
3.  Two-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field,
4.  Two-Dimensional Transport in a Diagonal Flow Field,
5.  Two-Dimensional Transport in a Radial Flow Field,
6.  Concentration at an Injection/Extraction Well,
7.  Three-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field,
8.  Two-Dimensional, Vertical Transport in a Heterogeneous Aquifer,
9.  Two-Dimensional Application Example, and
10. Three-Dimensional Field Case Study.
