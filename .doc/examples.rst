Original TWRI MODFLOW example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This problem is described in McDonald and Harbaugh (1988) and duplicated in
Harbaugh and McDonald (1996). This problem is also is distributed with
MODFLOW-2005 (Harbaugh, 2005) and MODFLOW 6 (Langevin and others, 2017).

Comparison of MF6 transport with MT3DMS Example Problems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The purpose of this script is to (1) recreate the example problems that were first described in the 1999 MT3DMS report, and (2) compare MF6-GWT solutions to the established MT3DMS solutions.
Ten example problems appear in the 1999 MT3DMS manual, starting on page 130.  This notebook demonstrates example 10 from the list below:
1.  One-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field
2.  One-Dimensional Transport with Nonlinear or Nonequilibrium Sorption
3.  Two-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field
4.  Two-Dimensional Transport in a Diagonal Flow Field
5.  Two-Dimensional Transport in a Radial Flow Field
6.  Concentration at an Injection/Extraction Well
7.  Three-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field
8.  Two-Dimensional, Vertical Transport in a Heterogeneous Aquifer
9.  Two-Dimensional Application Example
10. Three-Dimensional Field Case Study
