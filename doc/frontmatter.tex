\section*{Preface}
The document presents example problems for \mf.  The \mf program can be downloaded from the USGS for free.  The performance of \mf has been tested with these examples and other tests.  Future testing, however, might reveal errors that were not detected in the test simulations.  Updates are routinely made to the \mf program and to these examples.  Users can check for updates on the MODFLOW Web page (\url{https://doi.org/10.5066/F76Q1VQV}).

\section*{Acknowledgements}
