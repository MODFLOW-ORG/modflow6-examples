\section{PRT/MP7 Example 4: Backward Tracking on an Unstructured Quadpatch Grid}

This example demonstrates a MODFLOW 6 particle tracking (PRT) model by reproducing example problem 4 from the MODPATH 7 \citep{pollock2016modpath7} example problems document \citep{modpath7examples}. An equivalent MODPATH 7 model is constructed as well.

\subsection{Example description}

This example involves steady-state flow on an unstructured quad-refined grid. The grid has a large, irregular inactive region around its boundary. The left side of the grid is lined with injection wells. Two pumping wells are located in the refined region. Particles are released from two areas: around the horizontal faces of both pumping wells, and from a constant head boundary along the right side of the grid. Particles are then tracked backwards to terminating locations along the left side of the grid.

\subsection{Example Results}

In this example a MODFLOW 6 particle tracking (PRT) model runs after a flow (GWF) model~(fig~\ref{fig:ex-prt-mp7-p01-head}). The flow model provides PRT with intercell flows via a flow model interface.
