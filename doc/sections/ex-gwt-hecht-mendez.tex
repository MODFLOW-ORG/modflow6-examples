\section{Hecht-Mendez 3D Borehole Heat Exchanger Problem}

% Describe source of problem
The models presented in \cite{hechtMendez2010} apply MT3DMS \citep{zheng1999mt3dms} as a heat transport simulator.  Both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional demonstration problems are presented that explore the use of a ``borehole heat exchanger'' (BHE), a ``closed'' geothermal system that uses a heat pump for cycling water and anti-freeze fluids in pipes for mining heat from an aquifer \citep{diao2004}.  Figure~\ref{fig:hechtMendezBHE} depicts the kind of system modeled in this example.  

Among the examples presented in \cite{hechtMendez2010}, this work recreates the 3D example that simulates heat exchange between a BHE and the aquifer it is placed in.  Among the suite of examples included in the MODFLOW6-examples.git repo, this is the first one demonstrating the suitability of the GWT model within \mf for simulating saturated zone heat transport.  To verify the applicability of \mf6 as a groundwater heat transport simulator, we compare the \mf solution to established analytical solutions.  The analytical solutions are described in more detail below.

\subsection{Example description}

Through appropriate substitution of heat-related transport terms into the groundwater solute transport equation, \mf (as is the case with MT3DMS and MT3D-USGS) may be used as a heat simulator for the saturated zone by observing that the heat transport equation,
