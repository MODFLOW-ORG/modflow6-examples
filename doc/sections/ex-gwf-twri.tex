\section{\mf TWRI Example}

% Describe source of problem
This example is a modified version of the original MODFLOW example (TWRI) described in \cite{modflow88} and duplicated in \cite{harbaugh1996user}. This problem is also is distributed with \mff \citep{modflow2005} and \mf \citep{modflow6software}. The problem has been modified from a quasi-3D problem, where confining beds are not explicitly simulated, to an equivalent three-dimensional problem.

\subsection{Example description}
% spatial discretization 
There are three simulated layers, which are separated from each other by confining layers (fig.~\ref{fig:ex-gwf-twri-01}). The confining beds are 50 ft thick and have been added to the thickness of model layers 1 and 2, which lowers the bottom of model layer 1 and 2 from -150, respectively.
